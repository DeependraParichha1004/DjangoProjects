    <p>What is Chilli Paneer
One of the favorite dishes from Indian Chinese cuisine is Chilli Paneer which is a vegetarian version of Chilli Chicken.

In a typical Chilli Paneer recipe, the fried paneer cubes are tossed in a sweet, sour, spicy sauce. The paneer cubes can be coated with flours or batter coated and deep fried.

The dry version of chilli paneer is served as a starter or appetizer snack. The gravy version is had with steamed rice or noodles. The semi-dry version can be had as an appetizer.

This semi-dry chilli paneer recipe gives a truly restaurant style taste and flavor.

Tips for making Best Chilli Paneer
Paneer: Use homemade paneer for best results. If using frozen paneer, then soak them in hot water for some minutes.
Soy Sauce: If possible use naturally fermented soy sauce. You can even use tamari or bragg amino liquid instead of soy sauce.
Spring Onions: If you do not have spring onions (scallions), you can use shallots or regular onions.
Flours: Normally in restaurants, both corn flour and all-purpose flour are used to make the batter. You can even use whole wheat flour or rice flour instead of all purpose flour. In place of corn starch, you can use potato starch, tapioca starch or arrowroot flour.
Spicing:  You can add the amount of soy sauce, red chilli sauce, green chillies, black pepper, sugar and vinegar as per your requirements or taste buds.
Consistency: In this recipe, you can make the gravy slightly thick or having medium consistency. Just add slightly more water (about ¼ to ⅓) but do not add too much as then the flavors get diluted in the water. You can always check the seasonings and add more if required.

Frying: You can deep fry or shallow fry or pan fry the paneer cubes. But do not fry the paneer too much as then they become dense and loose their softness.
Vegan Option: Replace tofu with paneer.
Serving Suggestions: Serve chilli paneer with fried rice or schezwan fried rice or burnt garlic fried rice. It also goes well as a side dish with pulao or jeera rice or ghee rice. You can also have it with tandoori roti or naan or roomali roti. You can even have it as an appetizer snack with any chinese dipping sauce.
